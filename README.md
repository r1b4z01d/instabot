# Instabot

Instagram promotion and SMM scripts.
Forever free. Written in Python.

I have extended the awesome Instabot scripts to log data for all media liked. I added a script to analyze the logs and recommend what hashtags to continue to use. There are other scripts to find all hashtags you have used. More to come from this that I do not want to disclose yet.
